Maven 2 repository for java.net projects
The Maven 2 repository for hosting java.net projects libraries and dependencies is no longer active. This page documents how to use the new maven.java.net repository. Please follow the instructions here to deploy to maven.java.net.

POM Clean-up
You will need to clean-up your pom so that any references to the old maven2 repository are removed. The artifacts that were in Maven 2 repository (download.java.net/maven/2) have been migrated to Maven Central. The list of things to remove from the pom file is documented here.
